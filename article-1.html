                <p>Your skin is a reflection of your body’s overall health. When your skin looks dull and unkept it
                    could be caused as a result of a poor diet, no exercise or bad skincare habits. Today we are going
                    to tackle a healthy diet for natural glowing skin.</p>
                <p>All skin is different and it should be treated as such. A balanced diet is necessary for all skin
                    types but certain foods can cause breakouts for already oily skin and certain foods can cause
                    dehydration for already dry skin. So what should we include in our diet and what should we avoid?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <blockquote>
                        "There's a growing body of research showing that the food you eat can affect your complexion,"
                        says Dr. Jessica Wu, M.D., Los Angeles dermatologist and author of Feed Your
                        Face. "Food gets digested and enters your bloodstream, which then circulates to your skin."
                    </blockquote>
                </p>
                <p>Whether you need to treat acne, ward off premature aging, reduce the appearance of wrinkles, or fight
                    back against another pesky skin condition, the right diet can be a valuable aid. Researchers have
                    found that fitting certain healthy foods into your daily routine can help fight back against your
                    complexion woes by turning off inflammatory genes and providing your body with the proper tools to
                    strengthen and build healthy tissues. "Our skin reflects our health, and nourishing skin from the
                    inside as well as the outside is a recipe for optimal results," says Dr. Fred Pescatore, MD,
                    physician advocate for Pycnogenol, author, and natural health expert.</p>
                <p>So, what should you eat to get that glowing skin you want? Look for vitamin-rich fruits and
                    vegetables, and don't forget protein and healthy fats. <blockquote>"In general, I would recommend a
                        diet with sufficient protein and healthy fats and a wide variety of vitamins, minerals,
                        antioxidants, and other nutrients, "says Dr. Hadley King, MD, a board-certified
                        dermatologist based in New York City. "Vitamin C, for example, is important in the
                        synthesis of collagen, while vitamin D has been shown to decrease the harmful effects of
                        sunburn. Antioxidants may be able to decrease the effects of pollution and other environmental
                        dangers that create free radicals. And lycopene has been shown to provide protection from the
                        damaging effects of UV radiation. Proteins are broken down into amino acids, which are the
                        building blocks for all of the proteins found in the skin, hair, and nails, as well as in the
                        rest of the body. And sufficient healthy fats are necessary for the barrier function of our
                        skin."</blockquote>
